# TsMsx

TsMsx is a Work In Progress MSX emulator written from scratch in Typescript. You can run it in a browser and the current status is that it emulates a basic MSX1 system without Disk or cassette interface, but does not have a user friendly interface yet. Also the Z80 emulation contains a few bugs and does not pass the ZEXALL tests.

# How to build and run:
For building, NodeJS and typescript need to be installed. When that is done, one can build the software by
> npm install
> npm run build
> npm start
